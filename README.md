# sqlx

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jmoiron/sqlx.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jmoiron/sqlx) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/jmoiron/sqlx/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/jmoiron/sqlx?branch=master) [![Godoc](http://img.shields.io/badge/godoc-reference-blue.svg?style=flat)](https://godoc.org/github.com/jmoiron/sqlx) [![license](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-red.svg?style=flat)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmoiron/sqlx/master/LICENSE)

sqlx is a library which provides a set of extensions on go's standard
`database/sql` library.  The sqlx versions of `sql.DB`, `sql.TX`, `sql.Stmt`,
et al. all leave the underlying interfaces untouched, so that their interfaces
are a superset on the standard ones.  This makes it relatively painless to
integrate existing codebases using database/sql with sqlx.

Major additional concepts are:

* Marshal rows into structs (with embedded struct support), maps, and slices
* Named parameter support including prepared statements
* `Get` and `Select` to go quickly from query to struct/slice

In addition to the [godoc API documentation](http://godoc.org/github.com/jmoiron/sqlx),
there is also some [standard documentation](http://jmoiron.github.io/sqlx/) that
explains how to use `database/sql` along with sqlx.

## Recent Changes

* sqlx/types.JsonText has been renamed to JSONText to follow Go naming conventions.

This breaks backwards compatibility, but it's in a way that is trivially fixable
(`s/JsonText/JSONText/g`).  The `types` package is both experimental and not in
active development currently.

* Using Go 1.6 and below with `types.JSONText` and `types.GzippedText` can be _potentially unsafe_, **especially** when used with common auto-scan sqlx idioms like `Select` and `Get`. See [golang bug #13905](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/13905).

### Backwards Compatibility

There is no Go1-like promise of absolute stability, but I take the issue seriously
and will maintain the library in a compatible state unless vital bugs prevent me 
from doing so.  Since [#59](https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx/issues/59) and 
[#60](https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx/issues/60) necessitated breaking behavior, 
a wider API cleanup was done at the time of fixing.  It's possible this will happen
in future;  if it does, a git tag will be provided for users requiring the old
behavior to continue to use it until such a time as they can migrate.

## install

    go get github.com/jmoiron/sqlx

## issues

Row headers can be ambiguous (`SELECT 1 AS a, 2 AS a`), and the result of
`Columns()` does not fully qualify column names in queries like:

```sql
SELECT a.id, a.name, b.id, b.name FROM foos AS a JOIN foos AS b ON a.parent = b.id;
```

making a struct or map destination ambiguous.  Use `AS` in your queries
to give columns distinct names, `rows.Scan` to scan them manually, or 
`SliceScan` to get a slice of results.

## usage

Below is an example which shows some common use cases for sqlx.  Check 
[sqlx_test.go](https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx/blob/master/sqlx_test.go) for more
usage.


```go
package main

import (
    "database/sql"
    "fmt"
    "log"
    
    _ "github.com/lib/pq"
    "github.com/jmoiron/sqlx"
)

var schema = `
CREATE TABLE person (
    first_name text,
    last_name text,
    email text
);

CREATE TABLE place (
    country text,
    city text NULL,
    telcode integer
)`

type Person struct {
    FirstName string `db:"first_name"`
    LastName  string `db:"last_name"`
    Email     string
}

type Place struct {
    Country string
    City    sql.NullString
    TelCode int
}

func main() {
    // this Pings the database trying to connect, panics on error
    // use sqlx.Open() for sql.Open() semantics
    db, err := sqlx.Connect("postgres", "user=foo dbname=bar sslmode=disable")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalln(err)
    }

    // exec the schema or fail; multi-statement Exec behavior varies between
    // database drivers;  pq will exec them all, sqlite3 won't, ymmv
    db.MustExec(schema)

    // is taken into consideration.
    rows, err = db.NamedQuery(`SELECT * FROM person WHERE first_name=:first_name`, jason)
