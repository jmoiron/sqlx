# This is a fork from the [original repo](https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx) to keep some maintanance
Hi there,

I am a bit sad that the original developer abandoned the project and does not merge any more fixes and stuff, so I try to bring it to at least some life again. I would love to get some support doing that, so if you're interested in becoming a maintainer, feel free to contact me [@uvulpos](https://github.com/uvulpos)

## 🚧 NOT READY TO USE YET
Currently still work on the project setup so please come back later again :)

# go/sqlx

- **🧐 What is sqlx?**  
    sqlx is a library which provides a set of extensions on go's standard
`database/sql` library.
- **🚀 Why use sqlx?**  
    Marshal rows into Structs, Named Prepared Statements, `Get` and `Select` to go quickly from query to struct/slice
- **🤝🏻 comapitble**  
    sqlx leaves the underlying interfaces untouched and just superset on the standard ones
